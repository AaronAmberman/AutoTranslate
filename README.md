# AutoTranslate
Automatically translate string resources files into other languages.

## The Power
The driving force behind making this desktop application work is [LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate), website can be found [here](https://libretranslate.com/). Check GitHub link for additional mirrors.

## Usage
This application aims to keep is self free and MIT licensed. Translation services are a real world need and occupation so this may become challenging as time goes on. For now we will rely on the above public website (or rather all the available mirrors) to try to keep this working. There are ways for you to deploy LibreTranslate to your own server so the application will allow you to set which LibreTranslation URL you are interacting with. However, the provided URL **must** point LibreTranslate server or things won't work correctly.
