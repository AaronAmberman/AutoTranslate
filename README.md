# AutoTranslate
***Work in progress...very early alpha.***

Automatically translate string resources files from one spoken language to another. Works with .NET string resource files (.resx) or Qt translation files (.ts).

## The Power
This application will aim to use the M2M 100 translation model. This way translations are offline and unlimited.

## Usage

## Translation Providers
[CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2) with trained models (looking to use M2M-100) (offline, unlimited)

Using ML.NET to try to interpret m2m 100 data. May have to try to use IronPython or even just the python language.
